Suggestions for Developing your code submission for coursework part 2 

1. Complete your code in the first code cell in activity 4 of workbook 6.
 - the 'jupyter magics' on the first line of the cell  will save all the rest of your code in that cell  to a file called 'myVisualiser.py"

 - then run the second code cell in activity 4 and make sure you get a visualisation as you expect.
 
 
 2. Copy your file "myVisualiser.py" into this directory
 - this will remove any unexpected side effects due to running in a jupyter notebook
 
 3. Open a new terminal- from the right hand side of the main jupyterhub screen select the 'nerw' menu item then 'terminal'
 
 then use the command:
python3 pre_submission_test.py
This  will run a test script to try and use your code.
It is based on the code used in the marking system.
It will give you feedback if it encounters any errors or problems,
which mean you would score 0, but will not give you a mark.

4: Be mindful that it will not check your uwe user-name correctly - it is non-trivial for me to get that from this script, but it work on the marking server
